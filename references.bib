The three most common and typical types of references used in
IEEE publications:

an article in a journal
Note the use of the IEEE_J_EDL string, defined in the IEEEabrv.bib file,
for the journal name. IEEEtran.bst defines the BibTeX standard three
letter month codes per IEEE style.
From the June 2002 issue of "IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices",
page 996, reference #16.
@article{IEEEexample:article_typical,
  author        = "S. Zhang and C. Zhu and J. K. O. Sin and P. K. T. Mok",
  title         = "A Novel Ultrathin Elevated Channel Low-temperature 
                   Poly-{Si} {TFT}",
  journal       = IEEE_J_EDL,
  volume        = "20",
  month         = nov,
  year          = "1999",
  pages         = "569-571"
}


journal article using et al.
The (five) authors are actually: F. Delorme, S. Slempkes, G. Alibert, 
B. Rose, J. Brandon
The month (July) was not given here.
From the September 1998 issue of "IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in
Communications", page 1257, reference #28.
@article{IEEEexample:articleetal,
  author        = "F. Delorme and others",

  year          = "1995",
  pages         = "1244-1245"
}


a paper in a conference proceedings
"conference" can be used as an alias for "inproceedings"
From the June 2002 issue of "Journal of Microelectromechanical Systems",
page 205, reference #16.
@inproceedings{IEEEexample:conf_typical,
  author        = "R. K. Gupta and S. D. Senturia",

  month         = jan,
  year          = "1997",
  pages         = "290-294"
}


a book
From the May 2002 issue of "IEEE Transactions on Magnetics",
page 1466, reference #4.
@book{IEEEexample:book_typical,

  address       = "Reading, MA",
  year          = "1972"
}




Other examples

journal article with large page numbers, IEEE will divide numbers 5 digits
or longer into groups of three with small spaces between them. Page ranges
can be separated via either "-" or "--", IEEEtran.bst will automatically
convert the separator dash(es) to "--".
Authors and/or IEEE do not always provide/use the journal number, but it
was used in this case. IEEEtran.bst can be configured to ignore journal
numbers if desired.
From the August 2000 issue of "IEEE Photonics Technology Letters",
page 1039, reference #11.
@article{IEEEexample:articlelargepages,
  author        = "A. Castaldini and A. Cavallini and B. Fraboni
                   and P. Fernandez and J. Piqueras",
  title         = "Midgap Traps Related to Compensation Processes in
                   {CdTe} Alloys",
  journal       = "Phys. Rev. B.",
  volume        = "56",
  number        = "23",
  year          = "1997",
  pages         = "14897-14900"
}


journal article with dual months 
use the BibTeX "#" concatenation operator
From the March 2002 issue of "IEEE Transactions on Mechatronics",
page 21, reference #8.
@article{IEEEexample:articledualmonths,
  author        = "Y. Okada and K. Dejima and T. Ohishi",

  year          = "1995",
  pages         = "1047-1053"
}


journal article to be published as a misc entry type
date information like month and year is optional 
However, the article form like that below may be a better approach.
From the May 2002 issue of "IEEE Journal of Selected Areas in 
Communication", page 725, reference #3.
@misc{IEEEexample:TBPmisc,
  author        = "M. Coates and A. Hero and R. Nowak and B. Yu",

  month         = may,
  year          = "2002",
  note          = "to be published"
}


journal article to be published as an article entry type
year is required, so if absent, use the year field to hold
the "submitted for publication" in order to avoid a warning for
the missing year field.
From the June 2002 issue of "IEEE Transactions on Information Theory",
page 1461, reference #21.
@article{IEEEexample:TBParticle,
  author        = "N. Kahale and R. Urbanke",

                   Concatenated Codes",
  journal       = IEEE_J_IT,
  year          = "submitted for publication"
}





book with editor and no author
From the June 2002 issue of "IEEE Transactions on Information Theory",
page 1725, reference #1.
@book{IEEEexample:bookwitheditor,
  editor        = "J. C. Candy and G. C. Temes",

                   Design and Simulation",
  publisher     = "{IEEE} Press.",
  address       = "New York",
  year          = "1992"
}


book with edition, author and editor
Note that the standard BibTeX styles do not support book entries with both
author and editor fields, but IEEEtran.bst does.
The standard BibTeX way of specifying the edition is to use capitalized
ordinal words such as "First", "Second", etc. Most .bst files can convert
up to about "Fifth" into the format needed. IEEEtran.bst can convert up
to "Tenth" to the "Arabic ordinal" form IEEE uses (e.g., "10th"). For
editions over the tenth, it is best to use the "Arabic ordinal" form for
IEEE related work (e.g., "101st")
Note how "Jr." has to be entered.

U.S. patent
Use the type field to override the patent type. e.g.,
type = "Patent Application"
The address is that of the assignee. Note that IEEE does not
display the assignee, the address, and only displays one date.
(if year is not present, the filed dates are used.) However, this
information should be entered as other BibTeX styles may use it.
alternatively, nationality could be entered as "U.S." 
From the April 2000 issue of "IEEE Transactions on Communications",
page 542, reference #6.

French Patent request, the language field must be entered in lower case
as this is the option name Babel uses. The nationality field needs to be
capitalized. Because this is a patent request, the date filed fields are
used while the date fields are left empty/missing. In other countries,
the words "Patent Application", etc. are used instead.

Other unusual references

a private communication as a misc entry type
sometimes the designation "personal communication" is used instead

@misc{IEEEexample:private,
  author        = "S. Konyagin",
  howpublished  = "private communication",

}


an internet request for comments (RFC) as a misc entry type
It would also be nice to add a URL to these types of things.
RFCs can also be handled as electronic references.
From the April 2002 issue of "IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking",
page 181, reference #14.
@misc{IEEEexample:miscrfc,
  author        = "K. K. Ramakrishnan and S. Floyd",
  title         = "A Proposal to Add Explicit Congestion
                   Notification ({ECN}) to {IP}",

a software package as a manual
From the June 2002 issue of "IEEE/ASME Journal of Microelectromechanical
Systems", page 205, reference #20.
Sometimes they put the version/release information in the title.

  address       = "Beaverton, OR",
  year          = "1998",
  note          = "Release 4.3"
}


a software package as an electronic reference
From the February 2003 issue of  "IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking",
page 46, reference #24. If there is no author or organization, a sorting
key is required for sorting styles. It might be a good idea to include
month and year fields as well.
@electronic{IEEEexample:softonline,
  title         = "Ucb/lbnl/vint Network Simulator---ns (Version 2)",
  url           = "http://www-mash.cs.berkeley.edu/ns/",
  key           = "ns"
}


misc for a German regulation
In German, the first letters of nouns are capitalized, so we do so here.
From the June 2002 issue of "IEEE Journal in Selected Areas in

@misc{IEEEexample:miscgermanreg,
  title         = "{M}essung von {S}t{\"o}rfeldern an {A}nlagen

Ways to handle things like CCSDS's Blue Books
journal article with a URL. However, this is not a very good approach
because the Blue Books are not really journals and the author field has
to be abused.
From the June 2002 issue of "IEEE Transactions on Information Theory",
page 1461, reference #7.
@article{IEEEexample:bluebookarticle,
  author        = "{Consulative Committee for Space Data Systems (CCSDS)}",
  title         = "Telemetry Channel Coding",
  journal       = "Blue Book",
  number        = "4",
  year          = "1999",
  url           = "http://www.ccsds.org/documents/pdf/CCSDS-101.0-B-4.pdf"
}


CCSDS's Blue Book handled as a book
However, it is not a good idea to have to use the author field for
an organization (done here because the book entry type requires an
author field).
@book{IEEEexample:bluebookbook,
  author        = "{Consulative Committee for Space Data Systems (CCSDS)}",
  title         = "Telemetry Channel Coding",
  series        = "Blue Book",
  number        = "4",
  publisher     = "{CCSDS}",
  address       = "Newport Beach, {CA}",
  year          = "1999",
  url           = "http://www.ccsds.org/documents/pdf/CCSDS-101.0-B-4.pdf"
}


CCSDS's Blue Book handled as a manual
This is a much better approach, but uses the howpublished field.
@manual{IEEEexample:bluebookmanual,
  title         = "Telemetry Channel Coding",
  howpublished  = "ser. Blue Book, No. 4",
  organization  = "Consulative Committee for Space Data Systems (CCSDS)",
  address       = "Newport Beach, CA",
  year          = "1999",
  url           = "http://www.ccsds.org/documents/pdf/CCSDS-101.0-B-4.pdf"
}



CCSDS's Blue Book handled as a standard
Probably the best approach for this particular case because the work
is standard related. Note that IEEE does not display the address for
standards.
@standard{IEEEexample:bluebookstandard,
  title         = "Telemetry Channel Coding",
  howpublished  = "ser. Blue Book, No. 4",
  organization  = "Consulative Committee for Space Data Systems (CCSDS)",
  address       = "Newport Beach, CA",
  type          = "Recommendation for Space Data System Standard",
  number        = "101.0-B-4",
  month         = May,
  year          = "1999",
  url           = "http://www.ccsds.org/documents/pdf/CCSDS-101.0-B-4.pdf"
}








An example of a IEEEtran control entry which can change some IEEEtran.bst
settings. An entry like this must be cited via \bstctlcite{} command
before the first real \cite{}. The same entry key cannot be called twice
(just like multiple \cite{} of the same entry key place only one entry
in the bibliography.)
The available control fields are:

CTLuse_article_number
"no" turns off the display of the number for articles.
"yes" enables

CTLuse_paper
"no" turns off the display of the paper and type fields in inproceedings.
"yes" enables

CTLuse_forced_etal 
"no" turns off the forced use of "et al."
"yes" enables

CTLmax_names_forced_etal
The maximum number of names that can be present beyond which an "et al."
usage is forced. Be sure that CTLnames_show_etal (below)
is not greater than this value!

CTLnames_show_etal
The number of names that will be shown with a forced "et al.".
Must be less than or equal to CTLmax_names_forced_etal

CTLuse_alt_spacing 
"no" turns off the alternate interword spacing for entries with URLs.
"yes" enables

CTLalt_stretch_factor
If alternate interword spacing for entries with URLs is enabled, this is
the interword spacing stretch factor that will be used. For example, the
default "4" here means that the interword spacing in entries with URLs can
stretch to four times normal. Does not have to be an integer.

CTLdash_repeated_names
"no" turns off the "dashification" of repeated (i.e., identical to those
of the previous entry) names. IEEE normally does this.
"yes" enables

CTLname_format_string
The name format control string as explained in the BibTeX style hacking
guide.
IEEE style "{f.~}{vv~}{ll}{, jj}" is the default,

CTLname_latex_cmd
A LaTeX command that each name will be fed to (e.g., "\textsc").
Leave empty if no special font is desired for the names.
The default is empty.

CTLname_url_prefix
The prefix text used before URLs.
The default is "[Online]. Available:" A space will be inserted after this
text. If this space is not wanted, just use \relax at the end of the
prefix text.


Those fields that are not to be changed can be left out.
